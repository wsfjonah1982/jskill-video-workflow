# Visual Styles Reference — Seedance 2.5 / Seedream 5.0

Use this file when picking or reinforcing a visual style for an image or video prompt.
Always declare the style explicitly — the model can drift without reinforcement, especially
over multiple shots. The style names here match `config.json`'s `styles` list — reuse them
verbatim so the config stays a meaningful menu of what this skill actually supports well.

---

## How to Apply a Style in a Prompt

Style belongs in the **aesthetic description** layer of the core formula (see `best-practices.md`):

```
Subject + Motion + Environment + Camera/Cut + Aesthetic Description + Audio
```

Place the style descriptor early and reinforce it at each shot boundary if the clip has multiple shots.

```
[style descriptor], [aspect ratio], [duration]s.
Shot 1: [camera] [subject] [action], maintain [style] throughout.
```

**Key descriptors**:
- `cinematic realism`, `photorealistic`, `35mm film aesthetic`
- `natural ambient lighting`, `shallow depth of field`
- `film grain, anamorphic lens flare`
- `colour graded: teal-and-orange`, `desaturated cool tones`, `warm golden hour`

**Camera defaults**: Steadicam or handheld for drama; dolly/crane for epic moments.

```
Cinematic realism, 16:9, 10s.
Shot 1: [WS, golden hour, dolly-in] A middle-aged man in a worn leather jacket
walks slowly along an empty pier toward the water's edge, hands in pockets.

Documentary style, 16:9, 8s.
Shot 1: [MS, handheld, natural shake] An elderly fisherman repairs a net on a wooden
dock at dawn. He works with practiced, unhurried movements. Camera observes from a distance.

in the mesh — then pull focus to the grey ocean behind him.
no watermark, no subtitles, no artificial lighting
```

no 3D rendering, no photorealism
```

---

### 2D Japanese Anime

no photorealism, no 3D rendering, maintain anime style throughout
```

---

### 3D CG Realistic

**Character**: High polygon count, ray-traced lighting, physically based rendering (PBR). Looks like a high-end product render or architectural visualisation. Surfaces have realistic material response to light.

3D CG realistic render, ray-traced studio lighting, 16:9, 8s.
Shot 1: [static, eye level, MCU] A glass perfume bottle sits on a white marble surface.
Studio rim lighting catches the curved glass — caustic light patterns fan across the marble.

with amber warmth. Reflection of the studio softbox visible in the glass.
no watermark, no illustration style, no flat colour, no subtitles

```
3D Chinese fantasy CG style, xianxia aesthetic, 16:9, 12s.
Shot 1: [crane shot rising] A young immortal in white silk robes stands on a floating
stone platform above the clouds. Her sleeves billow in wind. Ink-wash mountains
recede beneath her.
Shot 2: [low angle, slow push-in] She raises one hand — golden qi particles spiral
upward from her palm, coalescing into a radiant sphere.
Shot 3: [ECU] Her eyes open — irises glow amber.
no photorealism, no live action, maintain CG style throughout, no subtitles
```

no vivid colours, no CG rendering, maintain ink-wash aesthetic throughout
```

---

### Lo-fi / Retro Film

**Character**: Grain, light leaks, desaturated or cross-processed colour. Feels like archival footage, Super 8, or expired 35mm. Warmth and imperfection are aesthetic goals.

**Key descriptors**:

**Example prompt**:
```
Flat design animation, minimalist, solid colour fills, no gradients, 16:9, 8s.
Shot 1: [static, WS] On a clean white background, a simple blue circle expands
from the centre of the frame — a stylised head appears within it.
Shot 2: [static] From the circle, three geometric icons radiate outward:
a book, a lightbulb, a speech bubble — each animating in with a smooth pop.
Shot 3: [static] Text appears below the icons: clean sans-serif, black.
no photorealism, no 3D, no texture, no gradients
```

---

### Dark Fantasy / Gothic

**Character**: Desaturated palette with selective deep jewel tones. Heavy use of shadow. Candlelight, moonlight, and bioluminescence as light sources. Environments feel ancient and decaying. Creatures and characters have heightened, dramatic design.

Shot 3: [ECU] A gauntleted hand closes around a cracked obsidian amulet.
no bright colours, no modern settings, maintain gothic atmosphere throughout
```

---

### Stop Motion

**Character**: Slight motion jitter between frames, visible texture of physical materials (clay, felt, paper, wood). Deliberate, slightly imprecise movement that communicates craft. Light may shift subtly between frames.

**Key descriptors**:

slight frame jitter, 16:9, 8s.
Shot 1: [WS, static] A small clay house sits on a miniature paper hill.
A clay figure with round hands pushes open the front door.
Shot 2: [MS, static] The figure steps onto the doorstep and looks up —
eyes are simple inset buttons that shift slightly with each frame.
Shot 3: [ECU] A clay hand reaches toward a paper flower.
no smooth digital animation, no CG shading, maintain claymation imperfection
```

---

### Watercolour Illustration

**Character**: Soft painted edges, colour bleeding and blooming, visible brushstrokes, translucent layered washes. Backgrounds often loose and impressionistic; subjects more defined but still painterly.

**Example prompt**:
```
Watercolour illustration style, soft bleeding edges, pastel palette,
visible paper grain, 16:9, 8s.
Shot 1: [WS, very slow pan] A painted forest path in autumn.
Leaves are loose watercolour washes of amber and gold — edges bleed into each other.
Shot 2: [MS, gentle push-in] A child in a red coat walks along the path.
Her figure is more defined; the background behind her remains impressionistic.
no sharp edges, no photorealism, maintain watercolour softness throughout
```

---

### Ukiyo-e / Woodblock Print

**Character**: Bold flat outlines, no gradient fills, strong diagonal compositions, stylised waves or clouds as background elements. Colour palette is limited and deliberate. Feels like a moving woodblock print.

**Key descriptors**:
- `ukiyo-e woodblock print style`, `Japanese heritage aesthetic`
- `bold flat outlines`, `limited flat colour palette`
- `stylised wave patterns`, `diagonal cloud formations`
- `no gradient, no shadow — flat fill only`
- `indigo, vermillion, and ochre palette`

**Camera defaults**: Static or very slow pan only — aggressive camera motion conflicts with the style.

**Negative constraints**: `no gradients, no 3D shading, no photorealism, no Western illustration`

**Example prompt**:
```
Ukiyo-e woodblock print style, bold flat outlines, limited palette of indigo and vermillion,
no gradients, flat colour fills, 16:9, 8s.
Shot 1: [WS, static] A great stylised wave rises at the centre of the frame —
outlined in bold black, filled with flat indigo. A small vessel rides its crest.
Shot 2: [slow pan right] Mount Fuji appears at the right edge — flat white peak
against a pale ochre sky filled with diagonal cloud formations.
no photorealism, no gradients, no 3D rendering, maintain flat woodblock aesthetic
```

## Style Combination Tips

Some styles can be layered for hybrid results:

| Combination | Descriptor example |
|---|---|
| Anime × Dark Fantasy | `2D anime style, dark fantasy palette, gothic atmosphere` |
| Ink-Wash × 3D CG | `3D CG render with ink-wash post-processing overlay` |
| Lo-fi × Documentary | `documentary style, Super 8 film grain, lo-fi colour` |
| Watercolour × Minimalist | `watercolour illustration, minimal composition, clean pastel fills` |
| Cyberpunk × Anime | `2D anime style, cyberpunk neon palette, rain-slicked urban setting` |

Always reinforce the combined style in each shot — hybrid styles are more prone to drift.

---

## Style × Common Issues

| Style | Most likely issue | Prevention |
|---|---|---|
| Any animation style | Style drift to realism | Reinforce style name every shot — see `common-issues.md` V-4 |
| 9:16 ratio (any style) | Subtitle generation | Switch to 16:9 in `config.json`, or add "no subtitles" — see V-2 |
| Multi-character scenes | Duplicate characters | Add "exactly one instance of each character" — see V-7 |
| Anime / 3D CG with multi-angle ref images | Twin-character issue | Clarify all angles are the same character — see V-7 |
